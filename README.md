# Gárdonyi Géza: A láthatatlan ember
## Project for CSC-270: Computational Approaches to the Humanities


My final project for this class was to create a website with my text where each sentence is linked with a Hungarian English translator to allow for more accessibility of the text.

It also offers citation for each paragraph to allow users to use the text as reference.
